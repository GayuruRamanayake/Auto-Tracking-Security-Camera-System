# Auto-Tracking Security Camera System

This project implements an **Auto-Tracking Security Camera System** designed to enhance surveillance capabilities by autonomously tracking and monitoring intruders or unusual activities. The system employs MATLAB for object detection, Simulink for simulation, and SolidWorks for camera design.

## Features
- **Real-Time Object Tracking**: Detects and tracks moving objects using MATLABâ€™s motion detection algorithms.
- **People Detection**: Utilizes `peopleDetectorACF` for intruder identification.
- **SolidWorks Integration**: Camera components modeled in 3D to represent the hardware design.
- **Simulink Simulation**: Simulates the mechanical system using the Simscape toolbox.
- **Robotics Toolbox**: Enhances control mechanisms for camera tracking and movement.

## Technologies Used
- **MATLAB**: For image processing and real-time object detection.
- **SolidWorks**: For 3D modeling and camera component design.
- **Simulink & Simscape**: For dynamic simulation and motion analysis.
- **Robotics System Toolbox**: For control algorithms and sensor simulations.

## Project Setup
To run the system on your local machine:
1. Clone this repository.
